# Engineer Level

## Objectives

- Automate AWS IAM resource management using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform).
- Integrate federated access for users and applications.

## Study Plan

### 1. IAM Automation with IaC

- Learn the basics of IaC and its benefits for IAM management.
- Explore AWS CloudFormation and Terraform for creating and managing IAM roles, policies, and users.
- Practice writing sample templates/scripts to automate:
  - User and group creation
  - Role and policy assignments
  - Permission boundaries

### 2. Federated Access Integration

- Understand federated authentication concepts (SAML, OIDC).
- Study AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) and its integration with external identity providers.
- Implement a sample SAML or OIDC federation setup.
- Practice mapping external identities to IAM roles and permissions.

### 3. Best Practices

- Use least-privilege principles for all IAM policies.
- Regularly review and audit IAM resources created by IaC.
- Implement version control for all IaC templates/scripts.
- Document and test changes before deploying to production.
